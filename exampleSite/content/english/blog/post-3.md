Our revolutionary multi-threaded omni-scanner is capable of digitizing any media with a single scan. From entire books to full-length VHS tapes, every page and frame is perfectly captured and re-encoded into an accessible digital format.

To create an archive, perform the following steps:

1. Place the media you'd like to scan onto the omni-scanner's platter.
2. Select where you would like to create the digital file (either locally, on your personal computer or external hard drive, or on our private cloud).
3. Initiate the scan by pressing the start button. 

And that's it! Within minutes you'll have access to your digital backup.

There's additional features, too. For example, you can toggle settings for books to include handwritten notes in the margin or not, or you can have video stabilization run automatically on the videos you short from your handheld VHS camcorder. For more information as media-specific features, see our \[docs\](#).
