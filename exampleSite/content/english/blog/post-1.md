If you purchase the Archive.it omni-scanner, you will always be able to archive your media locally for free. You already paid for the device. If we're not hosting your digital archives, then why should you have to keep paying us?

That's our 100% free guarantee.

That said, we do also offer additional features to those who may not want to be responsible for backing up a large archive or if you want to access your files remotely. For more information, see Subscribe for Remote Access.
