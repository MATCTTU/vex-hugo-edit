We support using local hard drives to store your archives, but this means you can only access your archives locally. A workaround is to create a Networked Attached Storage (NAS) device, properly setting this up requires technical and security knowledge. If you haven't already worked in a data center or IT role, this may not be feasible. 

If you want a maintenance-free way to access your files from anywhere with an internet connection through our web app or mobile apps, subscribe to one of our plans:

* Pay as you go
* Unlimited

### Pay as you go

With the pay as you go plan you only pay for the amount of data stored and streamed (in GB) that you use. You can set a maximum and limit and we'll alert you if you approach that cap. 

> This plan is best suited for avid readers as ebooks are small file sizes.

We bill at a rate is $0.05 USD per GB every month.

Note that we do not currently delineate between Standard and Cold storage rates. 

### Unlimited

The unlimited plan is just that, unlimited. For a flat rate of $15 USD every month. This plan included unlimited storage space and no caps on data streamed.

> This plan is best suited for avid videographers since video files are much larger than most other file types.

Note that only one session can access your archive at a time. The Unlimited plan does NOT remove this restriction.
